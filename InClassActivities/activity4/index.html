				</p>

				<p>
					Yesterday I went to the store and got some much-needed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XbCWmY0eqY">spatulas</a>! (What better way to say I love myself than to buy myself a spatula?) Should I grab a bottle or wine or 6 pack of beer hummmm maybe even some IPA. What are you thinking !?  Bruh hey Bruh are you going to decide or what.?

				<h2><span class="spanDate">02/10/2020</span>  : Cookie Monster Cupcakes</h2>
				<p>

				</p>

				<p>
					My favourite cartoon character is Cookie Monster, and my favourite dessert is cupcakes, so Cookie Monster cupcakes are the best of both worlds.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Did you know? Cookie Monster once said, <q>Sometimes me think what is love, and then me think love is what last cookie is for. Me give up the last cookie for you.</q> I wonder if the same applies for cupcakes? (If so, I don't think I can ever love ANYONE!)

				<h2><span class="spanDate">02/11/2020</span>  : Cookie Monster: Master Psychologist?</h2>
				<p>
					<img src="./monster.png" alt="Cookie Monster eating a cookie!" />
				</p>

				<p>
					C is for Cookie can be regarded as a case study in persuasive oratory, emphasizing the emotional aspect of public speaking. Cookie Monster builds excitement by answering his opening rhetorical question, "Now what starts with the letter C?" with the obvious reply, "Cookie starts with C!"
				</p>
				
				<p>
					He then challenges the audience, "Let's think of other things that starts with C," before quickly replying, "Oh, who cares about the other things?" casually dismissing a whole range of other possibilities as irrelevant. Thus, having ostensibly come for the purpose of covering the letter C in its entirety, Cookie Monster has already focused his agenda exclusively on cookies, employing the classic bait and switch tactic.
