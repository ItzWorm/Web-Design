1. This is possible by having style sheets for the different sites and departments of the school.

<p>
2. This could be accomplished by having a stylesheet for the whole website, having a style sheet for each department (or each grade, or both) and then allowing some styles to be overwritten. This way each site has a uniform feel but each grade or department will have a distinct look. There could be some modification of some classes to give each teacher's site a unique touch without eliminating the coherence.

3. Some useful/necessary classes are:
<ul>
	<li>contenteditable</li>
	<li>font-size</li>
	<li>font-family</li>
	<li>font-weight</li>
	<li>font-style</li>
	<li>color</li>
	<li>background-color</li>
	<li>marginleft</li>
	<li>marginrihght</li>
	<li>border</li>
	<li>border-collapse</li>
	<li>colspan</li>
	<li>width</li>
	<li>height</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
4. The code needed to style these elements is different for each class/tag. And would need to be put into CSS files and loaded such that the hierarchy is maintained. The "contenteditable" class in particular would be very useful for forcing teachers to keep some formatting for their site. As a note the width and height tags would be useful for tables and multimedia.
